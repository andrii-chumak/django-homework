# django-homework
In your homework, you should implement the coxit-academy application in this Django project. 
Example of models for this application [here](https://dbdiagram.io/d/62957e0cf040f104c1c6dc37) (It is just a recommendation) 
1. You need to implement the model layer. 
2. Prepare views with the lists of students, assignments, and lectures (it can be JsonResponse or render of the template) 
3. Prepare view for one parameterized query (Example, list of assignments for one specific lecture) 


Feel free to improve the model layer and experiment with your project.


# Update for homework #2

You need to implement API for coxit-academy models.
Endpoints for lists of assignements, homeworks and students
Endpoints for single assignement, homework and student
Endpoint for submissions by student id
Endpoint for lectures by lecturer id
